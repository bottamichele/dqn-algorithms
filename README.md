# DQN-Algorithms

## About
This repository is my personal library which contains the implementation in Python of 
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and its some variants with the goal of use one of these algorithms 
on my other projects and I don't have to implement one of them from scratch every time.

**NOTE:** if you want to use this library, you need to compile modules written in C that
can be found on the folder "[c_modules](https://github.com/bottamichele/dqn-algorithms/tree/main/dqn/c_modules)".

## External libraries used
The following external libraries used are:
- torch 2.1.2
- numpy 1.26.3
- gymnasium 1.0.0

The higher version should work fine.
